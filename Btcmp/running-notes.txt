Scheduler assigns node for the pending pod.

Control manager constantly runs the reconciliation loop .

Desired count of pods is always maintained by control manager .

HostPath 
Directory is mounted inside the container which is Directory on the host machine 
Data is retained in the pod even if the pod goes down but not available if pod is scheduled on the other node 

If you have same hostPath specified in two different connected to the same backing node , the data can be shared between those two pods . 

Have persistent volume ( created somewhere ) , now PVC binds PV to the pod and makes it available as volume, this volume is mounted inside the container with volumeMounts attribute 

Storage class:â€¨PVC is going to refer SC in its definition , when it is requested , k8s cluster is going to pv for the requested SC and it is going to get bound to Pvc , once it is available volume is going to get mounted inside the container 


Provisioners are provided by cloud service providers (csp) , csp is implementing the csi ( container storage interface ) specification to integrate the cloud specific storage with k8s cluster
